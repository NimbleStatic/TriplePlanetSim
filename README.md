# TriplePlanetSim
##Purpose
This is a hobby project, it's goal is to explore the movement of objects with gravity and to tackle (in a shallow and non scientific way) the problem of predicting the trajectory of these objects.
##Basic Plan
1.Create a simulation that will move objects in space based on the forces acting at such objects and their velocities.
2.Create a Gui that would display the movements of the objects.
3.Based on the known equations and the simulation guestimate the missing equations that would predict the movement of these objects
